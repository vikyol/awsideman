# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The User Management feature for awsideman CLI will enable administrators to manage users within AWS Identity Center. This feature will provide commands to list, get, create, update, and delete users in the Identity Store. It will follow the same command structure and user experience as the existing profile and SSO commands, providing a consistent interface for managing AWS Identity Center resources.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: User Listing

**User Story:** As an AWS administrator, I want to list all users in the Identity Store, so that I can view and manage the users in my organization.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user executes the `awsideman user list` command THEN the system SHALL display a table of all users in the Identity Store.
2. WHEN the user executes the `awsideman user list` command with a `--filter` option THEN the system SHALL display only users matching the filter criteria.
3. WHEN the user executes the `awsideman user list` command with a `--limit` option THEN the system SHALL limit the number of users displayed.
4. WHEN the user executes the `awsideman user list` command with a `--next-token` option THEN the system SHALL display the next page of results using the provided pagination token.
5. WHEN the user executes the `awsideman user list` command without a specified profile THEN the system SHALL use the default profile.
6. WHEN the user executes the `awsideman user list` command with a `--profile` option THEN the system SHALL use the specified profile.
7. IF no users are found THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate message.
8. IF an error occurs during the API call THEN the system SHALL display a clear error message.

### Requirement 2: User Details

**User Story:** As an AWS administrator, I want to get detailed information about a specific user, so that I can review their attributes and configuration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user executes the `awsideman user get` command with a user ID THEN the system SHALL display detailed information about the specified user.
2. WHEN the user executes the `awsideman user get` command without a specified profile THEN the system SHALL use the default profile.
3. WHEN the user executes the `awsideman user get` command with a `--profile` option THEN the system SHALL use the specified profile.
4. IF the specified user does not exist THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate error message.
5. IF an error occurs during the API call THEN the system SHALL display a clear error message.

### Requirement 3: User Creation

**User Story:** As an AWS administrator, I want to create new users in the Identity Store, so that I can add new members to my organization.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user executes the `awsideman user create` command with required parameters THEN the system SHALL create a new user in the Identity Store.
2. WHEN the user executes the `awsideman user create` command THEN the system SHALL require the following parameters:
   - `--username`: The username for the new user
   - `--email`: The email address for the new user
3. WHEN the user executes the `awsideman user create` command THEN the system SHALL accept the following optional parameters:
   - `--given-name`: The user's first name
   - `--family-name`: The user's last name
   - `--display-name`: The display name for the user
4. WHEN the user executes the `awsideman user create` command without a specified profile THEN the system SHALL use the default profile.
5. WHEN the user executes the `awsideman user create` command with a `--profile` option THEN the system SHALL use the specified profile.
6. WHEN the user is successfully created THEN the system SHALL display the new user's ID and details.
7. IF a user with the same username already exists THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate error message.
8. IF an error occurs during the API call THEN the system SHALL display a clear error message.

### Requirement 4: User Update

**User Story:** As an AWS administrator, I want to update existing users in the Identity Store, so that I can modify their attributes as needed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user executes the `awsideman user update` command with a user ID THEN the system SHALL update the specified user in the Identity Store.
2. WHEN the user executes the `awsideman user update` command THEN the system SHALL accept the following optional parameters:
   - `--username`: The updated username
   - `--email`: The updated email address
   - `--given-name`: The updated first name
   - `--family-name`: The updated last name
   - `--display-name`: The updated display name
3. WHEN the user executes the `awsideman user update` command without a specified profile THEN the system SHALL use the default profile.
4. WHEN the user executes the `awsideman user update` command with a `--profile` option THEN the system SHALL use the specified profile.
5. WHEN the user is successfully updated THEN the system SHALL display the updated user details.
6. IF the specified user does not exist THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate error message.
7. IF no update parameters are provided THEN the system SHALL display a message indicating that no changes were made.
8. IF an error occurs during the API call THEN the system SHALL display a clear error message.

### Requirement 5: User Deletion

**User Story:** As an AWS administrator, I want to delete users from the Identity Store, so that I can remove users who are no longer part of my organization.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user executes the `awsideman user delete` command with a user ID THEN the system SHALL delete the specified user from the Identity Store.
2. WHEN the user executes the `awsideman user delete` command without the `--force` option THEN the system SHALL prompt for confirmation before deleting the user.
3. WHEN the user executes the `awsideman user delete` command with the `--force` option THEN the system SHALL delete the user without prompting for confirmation.
4. WHEN the user executes the `awsideman user delete` command without a specified profile THEN the system SHALL use the default profile.
5. WHEN the user executes the `awsideman user delete` command with a `--profile` option THEN the system SHALL use the specified profile.
6. WHEN the user is successfully deleted THEN the system SHALL display a confirmation message.
7. IF the specified user does not exist THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate error message.
8. IF an error occurs during the API call THEN the system SHALL display a clear error message.

### Requirement 6: Common Functionality

**User Story:** As an AWS administrator, I want consistent behavior across all user management commands, so that I can use the CLI efficiently and predictably.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any user command is executed THEN the system SHALL verify that an SSO instance is configured for the profile.
2. WHEN any user command is executed THEN the system SHALL use the configured SSO instance for the profile.

4. WHEN any user command is executed THEN the system SHALL provide clear and consistent output formatting using Rich.
5. WHEN any user command is executed THEN the system SHALL provide helpful error messages if required parameters are missing.
6. WHEN any user command is executed THEN the system SHALL provide help text when the `--help` option is used.
