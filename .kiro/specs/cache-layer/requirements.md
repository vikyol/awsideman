# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for implementing a cache layer for the AWS Identity Center CLI. The cache layer aims to improve performance by reducing redundant API calls for commonly used read operations. The implementation will be done in phases, starting with a minimal cache layer and expanding to a more comprehensive solution in future phases.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a CLI user, I want basic caching of AWS Identity Center data so repeated commands avoid redundant API calls and respond faster.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user runs a supported read-only command THEN the system SHALL store the response in a local file-based cache.
2. WHEN the same command is executed again within a default TTL THEN the system SHALL return cached results.
3. WHEN cached data is used THEN the output SHALL match the structure and content of the original API response.
4. WHEN TTL expires THEN the system SHALL fallback to fetching fresh data and update the cache.

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a simple and extensible CacheManager that handles get/set operations and supports basic expiration checks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. The system SHALL provide a `CacheManager` class with methods: `get`, `set`, and `invalidate`.
2. The `CacheManager` SHALL check TTL expiration and treat expired entries as cache misses.
3. The cache implementation SHALL store entries in a flat file structure (e.g. JSON files in a cache directory).
4. The system SHALL include unit tests for CacheManager covering get/set/invalidate and TTL logic.

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a CLI user, I want to configure how long data is cached using simple TTL settings.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. The system SHALL allow default TTLs to be overridden via a configuration file or environment variables.
2. If no configuration is present, the system SHALL use hardcoded default TTL values for each data type.
3. TTL configuration SHALL be applied on the next operation without restarting the CLI tool.

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a CLI user, I want to manually clear the cache or view current cache configuration and state.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. The CLI SHALL support a `cache clear` command that deletes all cache entries.
2. The CLI SHALL support a `cache status` command that lists cache entries, expiration times, and total cache size.
3. The system SHALL gracefully handle missing or corrupted cache files during clear/status operations.

## Next Phase Requirements

The next phase will expand the initial cache layer into a full-featured, intelligent caching system for the AWS Identity Center CLI tool. This phase focuses on improving flexibility, automation, resilience, and observability of the cache system while keeping API usage efficient and transparent to the user.
