# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The current codebase has most functionality concentrated in the utils folder, making it difficult to navigate and maintain. This feature will reorganize the code into logical packages based on functionality - separating cache-related code, encryption code, and AWS client code into dedicated folders. This restructuring will improve code organization, maintainability, and developer experience.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want cache-related code organized in a dedicated cache package, so that I can easily locate and maintain caching functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reorganizing the codebase THEN the system SHALL create a cache package containing all cache-related modules
2. WHEN moving cache files THEN the system SHALL place file_backend.py and dynamodb_backend.py in cache/backends/ subdirectory
3. WHEN organizing cache modules THEN the system SHALL place backend_factory.py, cache_utils.py, and cached_aws_client.py in the cache package root
4. WHEN restructuring is complete THEN all cache-related imports SHALL be updated to reflect the new package structure

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want encryption-related code organized in a dedicated encryption package, so that I can easily manage security and encryption functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reorganizing the codebase THEN the system SHALL create an encryption package containing all encryption-related modules
2. WHEN moving encryption files THEN the system SHALL place aes_encryption.py, encryption_provider.py, and key_manager.py in the encryption package
3. WHEN restructuring is complete THEN all encryption-related imports SHALL be updated to reflect the new package structure

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want AWS client code organized in a dedicated aws_clients package, so that I can easily locate and maintain AWS integration functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reorganizing the codebase THEN the system SHALL create an aws_clients package containing AWS client-related modules
2. WHEN moving AWS client files THEN the system SHALL place aws_client.py and related AWS integration modules in the aws_clients package
3. WHEN restructuring is complete THEN all AWS client imports SHALL be updated to reflect the new package structure

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want core utilities to remain in a clean utils package, so that I can access common functionality without clutter.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reorganizing the codebase THEN the system SHALL maintain a utils package for core utility functions
2. WHEN cleaning utils package THEN the system SHALL keep config.py and error_handler.py in the utils package
3. WHEN restructuring is complete THEN the utils package SHALL contain only general-purpose utility modules
4. WHEN reorganization is complete THEN the utils package SHALL maintain proper __init__.py files for package initialization

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all import statements updated after reorganization, so that the codebase continues to function correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN files are moved to new packages THEN the system SHALL update all import statements throughout the codebase
2. WHEN imports are updated THEN the system SHALL ensure no broken import references remain
3. WHEN reorganization is complete THEN all tests SHALL continue to pass with updated imports
