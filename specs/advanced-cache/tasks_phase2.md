# Implementation Plan

## Overview

This implementation plan addresses the cache integration issue where commands don't use the cache system, causing cache warming to report "already warm" without actually caching data. The solution integrates the existing cache system with the command execution flow.

## Tasks

- [x] 1. Enhance AWSClientManager for cache integration
  - Modify AWSClientManager to accept cache configuration parameters
  - Add properties for cache_manager and cached_client
  - Update client getter methods to return cached clients when caching is enabled
  - Maintain backward compatibility with existing code
  - _Requirements: Cache system integration, backward compatibility_

- [x] 2. Create cache configuration utilities
  - Implement get_default_cache_config() function to load cache settings
  - Create create_aws_client_manager() factory function for consistent client creation
  - Add configuration loading from config files and environment variables
  - Ensure proper fallback to default settings when config is missing
  - _Requirements: Configuration management, environment variable support_

- [ ] 3. Update core command infrastructure
  - Add --no-cache option to command base classes or common utilities
  - Create helper functions for profile validation with cache integration
  - Update command parameter handling to support cache options
  - Ensure consistent behavior across all command types
  - _Requirements: Command consistency, user control over caching_

- [x] 4. Update user commands to use cached clients
  - Modify src/awsideman/commands/user/list.py to use factory function
  - Add --no-cache option to user list command
  - Update other user commands (create, delete, etc.) to use cached clients
  - Test that user commands properly cache and retrieve data
  - _Requirements: User management caching, command integration_

- [x] 5. Update group commands to use cached clients
  - Modify group commands to use create_aws_client_manager factory
  - Add --no-cache option to all group commands
  - Ensure group membership operations are properly cached
  - Test group command caching behavior
  - _Requirements: Group management caching, command integration_

- [x] 6. Update organization commands to use cached clients
  - Modify src/awsideman/commands/org.py to use cached clients
  - Update org tree command to properly cache organization hierarchy
  - Update org account and org search commands for caching
  - Test that org tree cache warming actually populates cache
  - _Requirements: Organization data caching, tree structure caching_

- [x] 7. Update permission set commands to use cached clients
  - Modify permission set commands to use factory function
  - Add caching support for permission set operations
  - Ensure permission set assignments are cached appropriately
  - Test permission set command caching
  - _Requirements: Permission set caching, assignment caching_

- [x] 8. Update assignment commands to use cached clients
  - Modify assignment commands to use cached clients
  - Add caching for assignment list and status operations
  - Ensure assignment operations work with cached data
  - Test assignment command caching behavior
  - _Requirements: Assignment operation caching, bulk operation support_

- [x] 9. Fix cache warming command integration
  - Update cache warming to work with the new integrated architecture
  - Ensure cache warming actually populates cache entries
  - Fix the "already warm" message when cache is empty
  - Test cache warming with different command types (user, group, org tree)
  - _Requirements: Cache warming functionality, accurate status reporting_

- [ ] 10. Add comprehensive testing for cache integration
  - Create unit tests for enhanced AWSClientManager
  - Test factory function with different cache configurations
  - Test command execution with and without caching enabled
  - Test cache warming with file and DynamoDB backends
  - _Requirements: Test coverage, reliability verification_

- [ ] 11. Update configuration system for cache settings
  - Extend existing config system to support advanced cache settings
  - Add support for DynamoDB backend configuration
  - Add support for encryption settings in config files
  - Test configuration loading and validation
  - _Requirements: Configuration management, backend flexibility_

- [ ] 12. Performance testing and optimization
  - Test cache performance with large datasets
  - Verify cache hit/miss ratios are working correctly
  - Test DynamoDB backend performance vs file backend
  - Optimize cache key generation for better performance
  - _Requirements: Performance optimization, scalability_

## Implementation Notes

### Priority Order
1. **Core Infrastructure** (Tasks 1-3): Essential foundation changes
2. **Command Integration** (Tasks 4-8): Update all commands to use caching
3. **Cache Warming Fix** (Task 9): Fix the primary reported issue
4. **Testing & Validation** (Tasks 10-12): Ensure reliability and performance

### Testing Strategy
- Each task should include unit tests for the specific functionality
- Integration tests should verify end-to-end cache behavior
- Performance tests should validate cache effectiveness
- Test both file and DynamoDB backends for each feature

### Backward Compatibility
- All changes must maintain backward compatibility
- Existing code should continue to work without modification
- New caching features should be opt-in where possible
- Default behavior should be sensible for most users

### Key Success Criteria
- `awsideman cache warm "org tree"` actually populates the cache
- Subsequent `awsideman org tree` commands use cached data
- Cache warming reports accurate statistics about entries added
- All commands support --no-cache option for debugging
- Performance improvement is measurable with caching enabled
