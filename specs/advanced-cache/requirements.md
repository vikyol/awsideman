# Advanced Cache Features Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for implementing advanced cache features for the AWS Identity Center CLI. This implementation adds encryption capabilities and DynamoDB backend support for enhanced security and scalability, providing enterprise-grade caching options.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a security-conscious user, I want to encrypt my local cache files so that sensitive AWS data is protected at rest.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN encryption is enabled THEN the system SHALL encrypt all cache data before writing to disk.
2. WHEN reading encrypted cache data THEN the system SHALL decrypt the data transparently.
3. WHEN encryption is enabled for the first time THEN the system SHALL generate and securely store an encryption key.
4. WHEN the encryption key is lost or corrupted THEN the system SHALL gracefully handle the error and allow cache regeneration.
5. The system SHALL support AES-256 encryption for cache data.
6. The system SHALL store the encryption key securely using the operating system's keyring/keychain.

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As an enterprise user, I want to use DynamoDB as a cache backend so that I can share cache data across multiple machines and have better scalability.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN DynamoDB backend is configured THEN the system SHALL store cache entries in a DynamoDB table.
2. WHEN using DynamoDB backend THEN the system SHALL maintain the same cache interface (get/set/invalidate).
3. WHEN DynamoDB backend is enabled THEN the system SHALL support TTL-based automatic expiration using DynamoDB TTL.
4. WHEN DynamoDB table doesn't exist THEN the system SHALL create it automatically with proper configuration.
5. The system SHALL support both local file and DynamoDB backends simultaneously.
6. The system SHALL allow configuration of DynamoDB table name and region.

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to configure cache backend and encryption settings through configuration files and environment variables.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. The system SHALL support configuration via config file (~/.awsideman/config.yaml).
2. The system SHALL support configuration via environment variables (AWSIDEMAN_CACHE_*).
3. WHEN no backend is specified THEN the system SHALL default to local file backend.
4. WHEN encryption is enabled THEN the system SHALL apply it to both local file and DynamoDB backends.
5. The system SHALL validate configuration settings and provide clear error messages for invalid configurations.

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to monitor and manage my cache across different backends through CLI commands.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. The cache status command SHALL show backend type and encryption status.
2. The cache status command SHALL display backend-specific metrics (DynamoDB table info, encryption key status).
3. The system SHALL provide commands to test backend connectivity and performance.
4. The system SHALL provide commands to repair or reinitialize cache backends.

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a security-conscious user, I want to rotate encryption keys and manage cache security settings.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. The system SHALL provide a command to rotate encryption keys.
2. WHEN rotating keys THEN the system SHALL re-encrypt all existing cache data with the new key.
3. The system SHALL provide a command to disable encryption (with appropriate warnings).
4. The system SHALL provide a command to enable encryption on existing unencrypted cache data.
5. The system SHALL securely delete old encryption keys after successful rotation.

## Technical Considerations

### Security Requirements
- Encryption keys must never be stored in plain text
- Support for hardware security modules (HSM) integration in future versions
- Audit logging for cache security operations
- Protection against timing attacks during decryption

### Performance Requirements
- Encryption/decryption overhead should be minimal (< 10ms per operation)
- DynamoDB operations should have configurable timeout and retry policies
- Batch operations for efficient DynamoDB usage
- Connection pooling for DynamoDB clients

### Scalability Requirements
- Support for multiple DynamoDB tables for different cache types
- Configurable DynamoDB read/write capacity modes
- Support for DynamoDB Global Tables for multi-region scenarios
- Efficient handling of large cache entries (> 400KB DynamoDB limit)

### Reliability Requirements
- Graceful degradation when backends are unavailable
- Automatic retry with exponential backoff for transient failures
- Health checks for backend connectivity
- Comprehensive error handling and logging
