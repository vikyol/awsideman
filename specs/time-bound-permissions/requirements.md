# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enables time-bound access management for AWS Identity Center, allowing administrators to grant temporary access to AWS accounts and permission sets with automatic expiration. The system supports both immediate and scheduled access grants while maintaining security through approval workflows and comprehensive audit logging.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want to assign temporary AWS account access to users or groups with specified start and end times, so that I can provide just-in-time access that automatically expires.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an administrator creates a time-bound assignment THEN the system SHALL store the start time, end time, user/group, account, and permission set
2. WHEN the end time is reached THEN the system SHALL automatically revoke the assignment from AWS Identity Center
3. WHEN creating an assignment THEN the system SHALL validate that the end time is after the start time
4. IF a user already has permanent access to the same permission set THEN the system SHALL NOT interfere with the permanent assignment

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want to schedule access grants for immediate or future activation, so that I can support both urgent requests and planned access needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating an immediate assignment THEN the system SHALL activate access within 5 minutes
2. WHEN creating a scheduled assignment THEN the system SHALL activate access within 5 minutes of the specified start time
3. WHEN handling time zones THEN the system SHALL store all times in UTC and display in user's local timezone
4. WHEN specifying duration THEN the system SHALL support both absolute end times and relative durations (hours/days)

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a security administrator, I want to require justification and approval for time-bound access requests, so that I can maintain security controls and audit compliance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user requests time-bound access THEN the system SHALL require a justification message
2. WHEN a request is submitted THEN the system SHALL route it to designated approvers based on organizational policy
3. WHEN an approver reviews a request THEN the system SHALL allow approval or rejection with comments
4. IF a request is rejected THEN the system SHALL notify the requester with the rejection reason

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a compliance officer, I want comprehensive audit logging of all time-bound access activities, so that I can track access patterns and meet regulatory requirements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any time-bound access action occurs THEN the system SHALL log who, what, when, and why
2. WHEN access is granted or revoked THEN the system SHALL record the exact timestamp and responsible party
3. WHEN generating audit reports THEN the system SHALL export logs in standard formats (JSON, CSV)
4. WHEN integrating with SIEM systems THEN the system SHALL support CloudTrail and Security Hub integration

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want automatic notifications before access expires, so that users and approvers are aware of upcoming changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN access will expire within 1 hour THEN the system SHALL notify the user and original approver
2. WHEN access revocation fails THEN the system SHALL immediately notify security administrators
3. WHEN sending notifications THEN the system SHALL support email, Slack, and webhook integrations
4. IF notification delivery fails THEN the system SHALL retry up to 3 times with exponential backoff

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a security administrator, I want to enforce maximum access duration policies, so that I can prevent excessive privilege escalation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating an assignment THEN the system SHALL enforce organization-defined maximum duration limits
2. WHEN duration exceeds policy limits THEN the system SHALL reject the request with a clear error message
3. WHEN policy limits are configured THEN the system SHALL support different limits per permission set or account
4. IF no policy is defined THEN the system SHALL default to a maximum of 8 hours

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want resilient automation that handles failures gracefully, so that expired access is always revoked even during system issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN revocation fails due to API errors THEN the system SHALL retry with exponential backoff for up to 24 hours
2. WHEN the system restarts THEN it SHALL resume monitoring all active time-bound assignments
3. WHEN AWS API rate limits are hit THEN the system SHALL implement appropriate backoff strategies
4. IF revocation ultimately fails THEN the system SHALL alert administrators and log the failure

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want to view and manage all time-bound assignments, so that I can monitor active access and troubleshoot issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing active assignments THEN the system SHALL display user, account, permission set, and remaining time
2. WHEN viewing assignment history THEN the system SHALL show granted, expired, and revoked assignments
3. WHEN managing assignments THEN the system SHALL allow early revocation of active assignments
4. WHEN filtering assignments THEN the system SHALL support filtering by user, account, permission set, and time range

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As an integration administrator, I want to connect time-bound access with existing approval systems, so that I can leverage current organizational workflows.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN integrating with ticketing systems THEN the system SHALL support Jira, ServiceNow, and generic webhook APIs
2. WHEN a request is created THEN the system SHALL create corresponding tickets in the integrated system
3. WHEN approval status changes in the external system THEN the system SHALL update the request status accordingly
4. IF integration fails THEN the system SHALL fall back to internal approval workflows

### Requirement 10

**User Story:** As a system operator, I want the system to handle high volumes of concurrent assignments efficiently, so that it can scale with organizational growth.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing concurrent assignments THEN the system SHALL handle at least 100 simultaneous time-bound assignments
2. WHEN system load increases THEN response times SHALL remain under 30 seconds for assignment operations
3. WHEN monitoring assignments THEN the system SHALL check expiration status at least every 5 minutes
4. IF system performance degrades THEN the system SHALL prioritize revocation operations over new assignments
