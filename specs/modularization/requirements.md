# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature aims to modularize large command files in the awsideman project by breaking them into smaller, more manageable submodules. The current command files have grown significantly in size, making them difficult to maintain, test, and understand. By dividing these files into focused submodules, we can improve code organization, readability, and maintainability. The new module structure will be implemented without breaking existing functionality. The CLI interface will remain unchanged, ensuring compatibility with existing commands. However, imports for relevant unit tests need to be updated and all tests should pass after the refactoring.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to break the assignment.py command file into submodules, so that I can more easily navigate, maintain, and test assignment-related functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the assignment.py file is refactored THEN the system SHALL create a new directory structure at src/awsideman/commands/assignment/
2. WHEN the assignment functionality is modularized THEN the system SHALL create separate files for assign.py, revoke.py, list.py, and helpers.py
3. WHEN the modularization is complete THEN the system SHALL maintain all existing CLI command functionality without breaking changes
4. WHEN the new module structure is implemented THEN the system SHALL include proper __init__.py files to maintain import compatibility

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to break the cache.py command file into submodules, so that I can better organize cache-related operations and improve code maintainability.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the cache.py file is refactored THEN the system SHALL create a new directory structure at src/awsideman/commands/cache/
2. WHEN the cache functionality is modularized THEN the system SHALL separate operations into logical submodules based on cache operations
3. WHEN the modularization is complete THEN the system SHALL maintain all existing cache command functionality
4. WHEN the new module structure is implemented THEN the system SHALL preserve all cache configuration and performance optimizations

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to break the user.py command file into submodules, so that I can organize user management operations more effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user.py file is refactored THEN the system SHALL create a new directory structure at src/awsideman/commands/user/
2. WHEN the user functionality is modularized THEN the system SHALL separate user operations into focused submodules
3. WHEN the modularization is complete THEN the system SHALL maintain all existing user command functionality
4. WHEN the new module structure is implemented THEN the system SHALL ensure proper error handling and validation across all submodules

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to break the permission_set.py command file into submodules, so that I can better organize permission set management operations and improve code maintainability.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the permission_set.py file is refactored THEN the system SHALL create a new directory structure at src/awsideman/commands/permission_set/
2. WHEN the permission set functionality is modularized THEN the system SHALL separate operations into logical submodules (list, get, create, update, delete, helpers)
3. WHEN the modularization is complete THEN the system SHALL maintain all existing permission set command functionality
4. WHEN the new module structure is implemented THEN the system SHALL preserve all permission set validation and error handling logic

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to break the group.py command file into submodules, so that I can better organize group management operations and improve code maintainability.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the group.py file is refactored THEN the system SHALL create a new directory structure at src/awsideman/commands/group/
2. WHEN the group functionality is modularized THEN the system SHALL separate operations into logical submodules (list, get, create, update, delete, members, helpers)
3. WHEN the modularization is complete THEN the system SHALL maintain all existing group command functionality
4. WHEN the new module structure is implemented THEN the system SHALL preserve all group validation and member management logic

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to break the status.py command file into submodules, so that I can better organize status monitoring operations and improve code maintainability.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the status.py file is refactored THEN the system SHALL create a new directory structure at src/awsideman/commands/status/
2. WHEN the status functionality is modularized THEN the system SHALL separate operations into logical submodules (check, inspect, cleanup, monitor, helpers)
3. WHEN the modularization is complete THEN the system SHALL maintain all existing status command functionality
4. WHEN the new module structure is implemented THEN the system SHALL preserve all monitoring configuration and notification logic

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all unit tests to continue passing after modularization, so that I can ensure the refactoring doesn't introduce regressions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN command files are modularized THEN the system SHALL update all relevant test imports to reference the new module structure
2. WHEN test imports are updated THEN the system SHALL ensure all existing unit tests continue to pass
3. WHEN the refactoring is complete THEN the system SHALL verify that test coverage is maintained across all modularized components
4. WHEN tests are run THEN the system SHALL execute successfully without any import errors or test failures

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the CLI interface to remain unchanged after modularization, so that existing users and scripts continue to work without modification.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the modularization is complete THEN the system SHALL maintain all existing CLI command signatures and behavior
2. WHEN users run existing commands THEN the system SHALL produce identical output and functionality as before refactoring
3. WHEN the CLI is invoked THEN the system SHALL properly route commands to the appropriate modularized components
4. WHEN error conditions occur THEN the system SHALL maintain the same error messages and exit codes as the original implementation
