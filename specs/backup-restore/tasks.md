## Current Status

**Phase 1**: ✅ **COMPLETED** - All core backup and restore functionality is implemented and working
**Phase 2**: 🔄 **PLANNED** - Cross-account restore infrastructure is complete, but data transformation layer is needed

### Known Limitations (Phase 2)

- **Cross-account restore** currently creates resources in the **source account's context** instead of the target account
- **Resource mapping** between accounts is not implemented (Identity Store IDs, account IDs, instance ARNs)
- **Data transformation** layer is needed to convert source account resource references to target account equivalents

### Infrastructure Status

- ✅ **Cross-account role assumption** - Fully working
- ✅ **S3 storage and credentials** - Fully working
- ✅ **API call infrastructure** - Fully working
- ✅ **Instance discovery** - Fully working
- ✅ **Parameter validation** - Fully working

The foundation for cross-account restore is complete and ready for Phase 2 enhancement.
