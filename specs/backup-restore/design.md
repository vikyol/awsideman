# Backup-Restore Feature - Design Document

## Overview

The Backup-Restore feature provides comprehensive backup and restore capabilities for AWS Identity Center configurations. The system enables administrators to create reliable backups of all Identity Center resources (users, groups, permission sets, assignments) and restore them for disaster recovery, environment migration, and compliance purposes.

The design follows a modular architecture with separate components for backup operations, restore operations, storage management, and scheduling. This separation ensures maintainability, testability, and allows for independent scaling of different operations.

## Components and Interfaces

### Backup Manager

```python
class BackupManager:
    def create_backup(self, backup_type: BackupType, options: BackupOptions) -> BackupResult
    def list_backups(self, filters: BackupFilters) -> List[BackupMetadata]
    def validate_backup(self, backup_id: str) -> ValidationResult
    def delete_backup(self, backup_id: str) -> bool
```

**Design Decision**: The BackupManager serves as the primary orchestrator to ensure consistent backup operations and centralized error handling. This design allows for easy extension of backup types and validation rules.

### Restore Manager

```python
class RestoreManager:
    def restore_backup(self, backup_id: str, options: RestoreOptions) -> RestoreResult
    def preview_restore(self, backup_id: str, options: RestoreOptions) -> RestorePreview
    def validate_compatibility(self, backup_id: str, target_env: Environment) -> CompatibilityResult
```

**Design Decision**: Separate restore manager ensures restore operations can be independently tested and optimized. The preview functionality addresses the dry-run requirement while maintaining separation of concerns.

### Storage Engine

```python
class StorageEngine:
    def store_backup(self, backup_data: BackupData, metadata: BackupMetadata) -> str
    def retrieve_backup(self, backup_id: str) -> BackupData
    def list_backups(self, filters: BackupFilters) -> List[BackupMetadata]
    def delete_backup(self, backup_id: str) -> bool
    def verify_integrity(self, backup_id: str) -> IntegrityResult
```

**Design Decision**: Abstracted storage layer supports multiple backends (filesystem, S3) with consistent interface. This design enables easy addition of new storage types and ensures backup portability.

### Data Collector

```python
class IdentityCenterCollector:
    def collect_users(self, options: CollectionOptions) -> List[User]
    def collect_groups(self, options: CollectionOptions) -> List[Group]
    def collect_permission_sets(self, options: CollectionOptions) -> List[PermissionSet]
    def collect_assignments(self, options: CollectionOptions) -> List[Assignment]
    def collect_incremental(self, since: datetime, options: CollectionOptions) -> IncrementalData
```

**Design Decision**: Separate collection methods for each resource type allow for selective backups and better error isolation. Incremental collection support addresses performance requirements for large environments.

### Export/Import Manager

```python
class ExportImportManager:
    def export_backup(self, backup_id: str, format: ExportFormat, target: ExportTarget) -> ExportResult
    def import_backup(self, source: ImportSource, format: ImportFormat, options: ImportOptions) -> ImportResult
    def validate_import_format(self, source: ImportSource, format: ImportFormat) -> ValidationResult
    def convert_format(self, data: BackupData, from_format: ExportFormat, to_format: ExportFormat) -> ConvertResult
```

**Design Decision**: Dedicated export/import manager handles format conversions and external system integration. This addresses requirement 8 for standard format support and data portability while maintaining separation of concerns.

### Schedule Manager

```python
class ScheduleManager:
    def create_schedule(self, schedule_config: ScheduleConfig) -> str
    def update_schedule(self, schedule_id: str, config: ScheduleConfig) -> bool
    def delete_schedule(self, schedule_id: str) -> bool
    def list_schedules(self) -> List[ScheduleInfo]
    def execute_scheduled_backup(self, schedule_id: str) -> BackupResult
    def get_schedule_status(self, schedule_id: str) -> ScheduleStatus
```

**Design Decision**: Separate schedule manager enables automated backup operations with configurable intervals. This addresses requirement 4 for automated scheduling while providing monitoring and management capabilities.

## Data Models

### Backup Data Structure

```python
@dataclass
class BackupData:
    metadata: BackupMetadata

    dry_run: bool
    target_account: Optional[str]
    target_region: Optional[str]
    resource_mappings: Dict[str, str]  # For cross-account/region restore

@dataclass
class RestorePreview:
    changes_summary: Dict[str, int]  # Resource type -> count of changes
    conflicts: List[ConflictInfo]
    warnings: List[str]
    estimated_duration: timedelta
```

**Design Decision**: Comprehensive restore options support all requirements including selective restore, conflict resolution, and cross-account operations while maintaining type safety.

### Export/Import Data Models

```python
@dataclass
class ExportFormat:
    format_type: str  # JSON, YAML, CSV
    compression: Optional[str]  # gzip, zip
    encryption: bool

@dataclass
class ExportTarget:
    target_type: str  # filesystem, s3
    location: str
    credentials: Optional[Dict[str, str]]

@dataclass
class ImportSource:
    source_type: str  # filesystem, s3, url
    location: str
    credentials: Optional[Dict[str, str]]
```

**Design Decision**: Flexible export/import models support multiple formats and storage targets as required by requirement 8 and 9, enabling data portability and integration with external systems.

### Schedule Configuration

```python
@dataclass
class ScheduleConfig:
