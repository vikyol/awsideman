# Backup-Restore Feature - Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Backup-Restore feature enables administrators to create comprehensive backups of AWS Identity Center configurations and restore them when needed. This feature supports disaster recovery, environment migration, configuration versioning, and compliance requirements by providing reliable backup and restore capabilities for all Identity Center resources.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to create comprehensive backups of my AWS Identity Center configuration, so that I can recover from disasters or migrate configurations between environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a backup is initiated THEN the system SHALL capture all users, groups, permission sets, and assignments
2. WHEN a backup is created THEN the system SHALL include metadata such as timestamp, instance ARN, and backup version
3. WHEN a backup is requested THEN the system SHALL support both full and incremental backup modes
4. IF a backup operation fails THEN the system SHALL provide detailed error information and partial recovery options
5. WHEN a backup completes THEN the system SHALL verify backup integrity and completeness

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to restore Identity Center configurations from backups, so that I can recover from data loss or apply configurations to new environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a restore is initiated THEN the system SHALL validate backup compatibility with target environment
2. WHEN restoring THEN the system SHALL support selective restore of specific resource types (users only, permission sets only, etc.)
3. WHEN a restore operation runs THEN the system SHALL provide dry-run mode to preview changes
4. IF conflicts exist during restore THEN the system SHALL provide merge strategies (overwrite, skip, prompt)
5. WHEN restore completes THEN the system SHALL generate a detailed report of all changes made



### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to export backup data to multiple storage targets, so that I can store backups in different locations for redundancy and compliance requirements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN exporting backups THEN the system SHALL support local filesystem storage
2. WHEN exporting backups THEN the system SHALL support S3 bucket storage with configurable paths
3. WHEN exporting to cloud storage THEN the system SHALL support encryption in transit and at rest
4. IF export to a target fails THEN the system SHALL continue with other configured targets and report failures
5. WHEN multiple export targets are configured THEN the system SHALL support parallel exports for performance

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a security administrator, I want to ensure backup and restore operations maintain security and audit requirements, so that sensitive identity data remains protected throughout the backup lifecycle.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN backups contain sensitive data THEN the system SHALL encrypt all backup files
2. WHEN backup operations occur THEN the system SHALL log all activities for audit purposes
3. WHEN accessing backups THEN the system SHALL enforce role-based access controls
4. IF unauthorized access is attempted THEN the system SHALL deny access and log security events
5. WHEN backups are transferred THEN the system SHALL use secure transport protocols

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to backup and restore configurations across different AWS accounts and regions, so that I can support multi-account architectures and disaster recovery scenarios.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN backing up across accounts THEN the system SHALL support cross-account IAM roles
2. WHEN restoring to different regions THEN the system SHALL handle region-specific resource mappings
3. WHEN working with multiple accounts THEN the system SHALL maintain account isolation and security boundaries
4. IF cross-account operations fail THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages about permission issues
5. WHEN multi-account backups complete THEN the system SHALL provide consolidated reporting

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to validate backup integrity and perform test restores, so that I can ensure backups are reliable and restoration procedures work correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN backups are created THEN the system SHALL generate and store integrity checksums
2. WHEN validating backups THEN the system SHALL verify checksums and data consistency
3. WHEN performing test restores THEN the system SHALL support isolated test environments
4. IF backup corruption is detected THEN the system SHALL alert administrators and suggest remediation
5. WHEN test restores complete THEN the system SHALL provide detailed validation reports

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to export and import backup data in standard formats, so that I can integrate with external backup systems and support data portability.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN exporting backups THEN the system SHALL support multiple formats (JSON, YAML, CSV)
2. WHEN importing external data THEN the system SHALL validate format compatibility and data integrity
3. WHEN working with large datasets THEN the system SHALL support streaming and chunked processing
4. IF format conversion fails THEN the system SHALL provide detailed error messages and partial recovery options
5. WHEN export/import completes THEN the system SHALL maintain full audit trails of data transformations


### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to schedule automated backups and monitor backup operations, so that I can ensure regular backups occur without manual intervention and quickly identify any issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN scheduling backups THEN the system SHALL support configurable backup intervals (daily, weekly, monthly)
2. WHEN automated backups run THEN the system SHALL execute without manual intervention
3. WHEN backup operations occur THEN the system SHALL provide real-time progress monitoring
4. IF scheduled backups fail THEN the system SHALL send notifications to administrators
5. WHEN backup monitoring is enabled THEN the system SHALL track backup success rates and performance metrics


### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a compliance officer, I want to maintain versioned backups with retention policies, so that I can meet regulatory requirements and maintain historical configuration records.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN backups are created THEN the system SHALL support configurable retention policies
2. WHEN retention period expires THEN the system SHALL automatically clean up old backups
3. WHEN multiple backups exist THEN the system SHALL provide versioning and comparison capabilities
4. IF backup storage reaches limits THEN the system SHALL alert administrators and suggest cleanup actions
5. WHEN backups are stored THEN the system SHALL encrypt sensitive data at rest
