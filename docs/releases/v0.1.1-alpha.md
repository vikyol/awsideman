## üìã **Migration Notes**

### **For S3 Backend Users**
```yaml
# Before (will now fail)
cache:
  backend_type: "s3"
  s3_bucket: "my-bucket"

# After (required)
cache:
  backend_type: "s3"
  s3_bucket: "my-bucket"
  s3_profile: "production"  # REQUIRED
```

### **For File Backend Users**
- Cache and backup data will automatically be organized in profile-specific folders
- No configuration changes required
- Existing data will be migrated automatically
