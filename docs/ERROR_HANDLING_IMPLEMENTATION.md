## Error Categories and Handling

### Error Categories
1. **Network**: Connection timeouts, DNS issues, network unreachability
2. **Authentication**: Token expiration, invalid credentials
3. **Authorization**: Access denied, insufficient permissions
4. **Rate Limiting**: API throttling, request limits exceeded
5. **Resource Not Found**: Missing users, groups, permission sets
6. **Resource Conflict**: Duplicate resources, naming conflicts
7. **Validation**: Invalid parameters, data format issues
8. **Storage**: File system errors, S3 access issues
9. **Encryption**: Key management, encryption/decryption failures
10. **Configuration**: Invalid settings, missing configuration

### Retry Logic
- **Retryable Errors**: Network, Rate Limiting, Resource Conflicts
- **Non-Retryable Errors**: Authentication, Authorization, Validation
- **Exponential Backoff**: Base delay × (exponential_base ^ attempt)
- **Jitter**: Optional randomization to prevent thundering herd
- **Max Delay Cap**: Prevents excessively long delays

### Recovery Strategies
1. **Retry**: For transient errors (network, throttling)
2. **Partial Recovery**: For backup operations with partial failures
3. **Rollback**: For restore operations with applied changes
4. **Skip**: For non-critical conflicts
5. **Manual Intervention**: For critical errors requiring human action

## Usage Examples

### Basic Error Handling
```python
from src.awsideman.backup_restore.enhanced_backup_manager import EnhancedBackupManager
from src.awsideman.backup_restore.error_handling import RetryConfig

# Configure retry behavior
retry_config = RetryConfig(
    max_retries=3,
    base_delay=1.0,
    max_delay=60.0,
    exponential_base=2.0,
    jitter=True
)

# Create enhanced backup manager
manager = EnhancedBackupManager(
    collector=collector,
    storage_engine=storage_engine,
    retry_config=retry_config
)

# Execute backup with automatic error handling
result = await manager.create_backup(options)
if not result.success:
    print(f"Backup failed: {result.message}")
    print("Suggested actions:", result.errors)
```

### Rollback on Restore Failure
```python
from src.awsideman.backup_restore.enhanced_restore_manager import EnhancedRestoreManager

# Create enhanced restore manager
restore_manager = EnhancedRestoreManager(
    storage_engine=storage_engine,
    identity_center_client=identity_center_client,
    identity_store_client=identity_store_client
)

# Execute restore with automatic rollback on failure
result = await restore_manager.restore_backup(backup_id, options)
if not result.success:
    print(f"Restore failed: {result.message}")
    if "Rollback successful" in result.message:
        print("Changes were automatically rolled back")
```

### Manual Error Analysis
```python
from src.awsideman.backup_restore.error_handling import ErrorAnalyzer

analyzer = ErrorAnalyzer()

try:
    # Some operation that might fail
    await risky_operation()
except Exception as e:
    error_info = analyzer.analyze_error(e, {'operation': 'backup'})

    print(f"Error Category: {error_info.category.value}")
    print(f"Severity: {error_info.severity.value}")
    print(f"Recoverable: {error_info.recoverable}")
    print("Suggested Actions:")
    for action in error_info.suggested_actions:
        print(f"  - {action}")
```

## Testing

### Unit Tests
- **test_error_handling.py**: Comprehensive tests for all error handling components
- **test_enhanced_managers.py**: Integration tests for enhanced managers
- **Coverage**: All error scenarios, retry logic, recovery mechanisms, and rollback capabilities

### Test Scenarios Covered
1. **Error Analysis**: Different error types and categorization
2. **Retry Logic**: Successful retries, retry exhaustion, non-retryable errors
3. **Partial Recovery**: Backup operations with partial failures
4. **Rollback**: Successful rollback, partial rollback failures
5. **Error Reporting**: Multi-error reports, remediation suggestions
6. **Integration**: End-to-end error handling in enhanced managers

## Performance Considerations

### Retry Performance
- **Fast Failure**: Non-retryable errors fail immediately
- **Exponential Backoff**: Prevents overwhelming services during recovery
- **Jitter**: Reduces thundering herd effects
- **Max Delay Cap**: Prevents excessively long waits

### Memory Management
- **Operation State Cleanup**: Automatic cleanup after configurable delay
- **Checkpoint Optimization**: Only stores essential data for recovery
- **Rollback Action Cleanup**: Clears rollback actions after successful completion

### Monitoring Integration
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time progress updates during operations
- **Operation State**: Detailed state tracking for monitoring and debugging
- **Error Metrics**: Categorized error reporting for operational insights

## Security Considerations

### Error Information
- **Sensitive Data**: Error messages sanitized to prevent information leakage
- **Stack Traces**: Only included in debug mode, not in production logs
- **Context Data**: Filtered to exclude credentials and sensitive configuration

### Rollback Security
- **Permission Validation**: Rollback actions validate permissions before execution
- **Audit Logging**: All rollback actions are logged for security audit
- **Secure Cleanup**: Sensitive data in rollback actions is securely cleared

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Improvements
1. **Machine Learning**: Error pattern recognition for predictive failure prevention
2. **Advanced Recovery**: More sophisticated partial recovery strategies
3. **Distributed Rollback**: Support for rollback across multiple AWS accounts
4. **Performance Optimization**: Parallel rollback execution for large operations
5. **Enhanced Monitoring**: Integration with AWS CloudWatch and custom metrics

### Configuration Extensions
1. **Custom Error Handlers**: Pluggable error handling strategies
2. **Recovery Policies**: Configurable recovery behavior per error type
3. **Notification Integration**: Automatic alerts for critical errors
4. **Rollback Policies**: Fine-grained control over rollback behavior

## Conclusion

The comprehensive error handling and recovery system provides robust, production-ready error management for AWS Identity Manager backup-restore operations. It addresses all requirements for retry logic, partial recovery, rollback capabilities, and detailed error reporting while maintaining high performance and security standards.

The implementation follows best practices for error handling in distributed systems and provides extensive testing coverage to ensure reliability in production environments.
