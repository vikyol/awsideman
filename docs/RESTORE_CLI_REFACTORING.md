# Restore CLI Commands - Refactoring Summary

## Overview

This document outlines the refactoring of the restore CLI commands implementation to align with the established patterns used in other command modules like the user and backup commands.

## Previous Implementation Issues

### 1. **Single Large File**
- **Before**: One large file `restore_operations.py` (23KB, 604 lines)
- **After**: Three focused files with single responsibilities

### 2. **Mixed Responsibilities**
- **Before**: Multiple commands in one file with overlapping functionality
- **After**: Each command is in its own focused file

### 3. **Inconsistent Structure**
- **Before**: Different from the improved backup command pattern
- **After**: Follows the exact same structure as backup and user commands

## New Structure

### Core Restore Commands
- `restore.py` - Main restore operation (12KB, 286 lines)
- `preview.py` - Preview restore changes (12KB, 269 lines)
- `validate.py` - Validate backup compatibility (10KB, 223 lines)

## Implementation Details

### Command Registration Pattern
```python
# Before: Complex add_typer with hidden apps
app.add_typer(restore_ops_app, name="", hidden=True)

# After: Direct command registration
app.command("restore")(restore_backup)
app.command("preview")(preview_restore)
app.command("validate")(validate_restore)
```

### File Organization
```python
# Before: Single large file
restore_operations.py (23KB, 604 lines)

# After: Focused, single-responsibility files
restore.py (12KB, 286 lines)
preview.py (12KB, 269 lines)
validate.py (10KB, 223 lines)
```

### Import Structure
```python
# Before: Complex nested imports
from .restore_operations import app as restore_ops_app

# After: Clean, direct imports
from .restore import restore_backup
from .preview import preview_restore
from .validate import validate_restore
```

## Command Features

### 1. **restore** - Main Restore Operation
- **Selective Resource Restore**: Restore specific resource types (users, groups, permission sets, assignments)
- **Conflict Resolution**: Multiple strategies (overwrite, skip, prompt, merge)
- **Cross-Account/Region**: Support for restoring to different AWS accounts and regions
- **Dry-Run Mode**: Preview changes before applying them
- **Validation**: Optional compatibility validation before restore

**Examples:**
```bash
# Restore all resources
$ awsideman restore backup-123

# Restore only users and groups
$ awsideman restore backup-123 --resources users,groups

# Cross-account restore
$ awsideman restore backup-123 --target-account 123456789012 --target-region us-west-2

# Dry-run restore
$ awsideman restore backup-123 --dry-run
```

### 2. **preview** - Restore Preview
- **Change Preview**: Shows what changes would be made without applying them
- **Resource Breakdown**: Detailed view of resources to be restored
- **Conflict Detection**: Identifies potential conflicts before restore
- **Next Steps Guidance**: Clear instructions for proceeding with restore

**Examples:**
```bash
# Preview restore of all resources
$ awsideman restore preview backup-123

# Preview specific resources
$ awsideman restore preview backup-123 --resources users,groups

# Preview with conflict resolution strategy
$ awsideman restore preview backup-123 --conflict-strategy overwrite
```

### 3. **validate** - Compatibility Validation
- **Environment Compatibility**: Validates backup compatibility with target environment
- **Cross-Account Validation**: Checks account and region compatibility
- **Resource Dependencies**: Validates resource dependencies and constraints
- **Detailed Reporting**: Comprehensive validation results with recommendations

**Examples:**
```bash
# Validate with current environment
$ awsideman restore validate backup-123

# Validate for cross-account restore
$ awsideman restore validate backup-123 --target-account 123456789012

# Validate for cross-region restore
$ awsideman restore validate backup-123 --target-region us-west-2
```

## Benefits of the New Structure

### 1. **Maintainability**
- Each command is in its own focused file
- Clear separation of concerns
- Easier to locate and modify specific functionality

### 2. **Consistency**
- Follows the same pattern as user, group, and backup command modules
- Predictable structure for developers
- Easier onboarding for new contributors

### 3. **Testability**
- Individual commands can be tested in isolation
- Smaller, focused files are easier to unit test
- Clear boundaries for mocking and test setup

### 4. **Scalability**
- Easy to add new restore commands by creating new files
- No need to modify large, complex files
- Clear pattern for future command additions

### 5. **Code Quality**
- Reduced file sizes improve readability
- Single responsibility principle enforced
- Easier code review and quality checks

## Migration Notes

### Backward Compatibility
- All existing CLI commands remain available
- Command syntax and options unchanged
- Help text and examples preserved

### Implementation Status
- **Fully Implemented**: restore, preview, validate commands
- **No Placeholder Commands**: All restore functionality is complete
- **Ready for Production**: All commands are fully functional

### Dependencies
- Maintains all existing dependencies on backup_restore modules
- Uses same validation and configuration patterns
- Preserves error handling and user experience

## Future Enhancements

### 1. **Additional Restore Commands**
- Restore rollback functionality
- Restore history and audit logging
- Restore performance optimization

### 2. **Enhanced Validation**
- More detailed compatibility checks
- Resource dependency validation
- Performance impact assessment

### 3. **Advanced Features**
- Restore templates and presets
- Automated restore workflows
- Restore monitoring and alerting

## Conclusion

The restructured restore CLI commands now follow the same architectural principles as the rest of the codebase, providing:

- **Better maintainability** through focused, single-responsibility files
- **Improved consistency** with other command modules
- **Enhanced developer experience** through predictable structure
- **Easier testing** and quality assurance
- **Clear path for future enhancements**

This refactoring aligns with the project's architectural principles and makes the restore functionality more accessible and maintainable for developers and administrators alike. The restore commands are now fully implemented and ready for production use, with a clean, consistent structure that matches the improved backup command organization.
